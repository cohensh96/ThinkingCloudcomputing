# TCC - Think Cloud Computing
The cloud computing learning website is an innovative and interactive platform designed to cater to users seeking to expand their knowledge and understanding of cloud computing in an engaging and enjoyable manner. With a strong emphasis on making learning fun and accessible to all, the website features a diverse range of educational games centered around cloud computing topics. One of the main attractions is the trivia game, where users can test their knowledge through a variety of challenging questions related to cloud computing concepts. This playful learning approach appeals to a wide audience, accommodating individuals of all backgrounds and interests who wish to learn about the intricacies of cloud computing.

The website offers a user-friendly interface and a seamless navigation experience, featuring several essential screens to enhance the overall user experience. Users can easily create accounts through the registration screen or log in to access personalized features. By logging in, users can track their progress, achievements, and scores, providing a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue learning. Additionally, the leaderboards screen adds a competitive element to the platform, allowing users to compete with others and earn a spot among the top-performing participants in the trivia game.

The website leverages various technologies and programming languages to ensure its smooth operation and functionality. It runs entirely on the Google Collab platform, a cloud-based development environment that supports the Python programming language. Flask, a powerful Python web framework, is utilized for the backend implementation of the website, managing routing and data processing effectively. Jinja 2, the templating engine employed by Flask, allows seamless integration of Python code within HTML files, enhancing the dynamic nature of the user interface.

To provide an independent window for viewing the website, ngrok, a hosting tool, generates a public URL for the local server, enabling external access to the platform. Furthermore, the website connects to the Firebase Realtime Database for efficient data storage and management, facilitating user profiles, game statistics, and leaderboard updates. Additionally, external files from Google Drive, which comprise HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, are imported to support the overall design and logic of the website.

In summary, the cloud computing learning website combines the power of playful learning, interactive trivia games, and user-friendly navigation to make cloud computing education accessible and enjoyable to a diverse audience. With a thoughtful selection of technologies and programming languages, the website ensures seamless operation and efficient data management, promising a rewarding and enriching learning experience for users interested in exploring the world of cloud computing.
